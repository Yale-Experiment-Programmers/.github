# Yale Experiment Programmers Organization

The Yale Experiment Programmers Organization (YEPO) is a community of researchers across many disciplines, including the School of Medicine, Neuroscience, Psychology, Behavioral Economics, and more. Researchers in our community all share an interest in developing tasks and surveys to study human behavior, both in-person and online.

Our mission is to advocate for best practices for developing behavioral experiments and questionnaires by providing a space for collaboration, learning and sharing of knowledge. We aim to expose individuals to techniques beyond the scope of their training and foster cross-disciplinary pollination.

With the support of the Wu Tsai Institute at Yale, we are currently developing workshops to explore techniques from computer-based fields as they apply to the traditional experiment paradigm. These workshops are designed to make these seemingly challenging or foreign concepts accessible even to the most novice researchers.

We are actively looking to include people interested in teaching and learning in our community. If you are interested in learning more about our organization, please feel free to contact Evan Kirkiles, Yale College â€™24 at <evan.kirkiles@yale.edu> or Josh Kenney, Research Associate III at the Belief, Learning & Memory Lab at <joshua.kenney@yale.edu>.
